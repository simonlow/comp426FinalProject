            <p>Serene walking paths take you past wildflowers and trees in this 5-acre gem on the UNC campus. Rest on one of several open lawns, or take a seat on a shady bench. Coker Arboretum changes with the seasons. From spring blooms to summer greenery, fall color to winter grace, thereâ€™s always something to see.</p>
